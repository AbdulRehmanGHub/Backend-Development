form handling, sessions, cookies etc

-- Form Handling.
to handle the backend process of data coming from any frontend source, library, frameworks, files etc.

--Session
We can put our data on frontend and whenever we request backend, the data from frontend saved in backend. Session make sure to keep the data in mind whenever the user again request it.

For example: User Authentications - user one time login and then close the browser, whenever the user open the website again he/she should be logged in. No need to login again and again.

So, we can say that from user login to user logout, this is a session.

--Cookie
A cookie (also known as a web cookie or browser cookie) is a small piece of data a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store cookies, create new cookies, modify existing ones, and send them back to the same server with later requests. Cookies enable web applications to store limited amounts of data and remember state information; by default the HTTP protocol is stateless.

-- Cookie Parser
Parse Cookie header and populate req.cookies with an object keyed by the cookie names. Optionally you may enable signed cookie support by passing a secret string, which assigns req.secret so it may be used by other middleware.

command: npm i cookie-parser
